Batch Import Concrete Example
========================

### What's Needed

1. A registered Camio account
2. A [batch-import-enabled Camio Box Virtual Machine](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002492123)
3. An OAuth token for your Camio account (gotten from [the integrations page](https://www.camio.com/settings/integrations/#api))
4. The Camio Box IP address (explained in the [get IP address section](#get-the-camio-box-ip-address))
5. [The testing directory of videos](https://storage.googleapis.com/camio_firmware_images/batch_import_video_files.zip)
6. A regular-expression describing how to parse your input filenames ([described here](#constructing-the-file-parsing-regex))
7. Python Version 2.7 (installed by default on OSX and Linux, can be obtained from the [python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for Windows)

Once you have all of the items listed above, you can start to batch-import videos to Camio.

### Instructions

#### Obtain and Set-up Your Batch-Import Enabled Camio Box

Follow all of the instructions listed in [this help article for setting up Camio Box VM in VirtualBox](https://help.camio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002492123).

#### Boot-Up Your Camio Box

Your Camio Box needs to be powered on, registered under your account, and on the same local network as the computer running the batch-importer script.
Your Camio Box can be registered through [the /box/register page](https://www.camio.com/box/register).

#### Clone the Importer and Use the Camio Hooks

Start by cloning the [Camio examples](https://www.github.com/CamioCam/examples) repository, go into the 
[examples/batch_import/video-importer](examples/batch_import/video-importer) directory. Then run the `setup.py` script
to install the package onto your system.

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/CamioCam/examples

#### Set the Necessary Environment Variables

For the video-import script to work properly with Camio and the [camio_hooks.py](examples/batch_import/camio_hooks.py) module, a few environment 
variables must be defined. These are

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ------------|
| `CAMIO_OAUTH_TOKEN` | set this to the Developer OAuth token that is generated from your [Camio settings](https://camio.com/settings/integrations#api) page. |
| `CAMIO_BOX_DEVICE_ID` | set this to the `device_id` of the [Camio Box](https://camio.com/box) that's processing your imported video files. You can get your  `device_id` from your [/boxes](https://camio.com/boxes) page by looking for the `#device_id=XXX` URL hash parameter. Camio is adding an easier means to obtain the device ID but as of right now this is the easiest way to get it. |

You can set these by just entering the following in your shell

```sh
$ export CAMIO_OAUTH_TOKEN="qdSxve9OtdpPlcsyqzhzN95cYAE7A_P" # insert your oauth token here
$ export CAMIO_BOX_DEVICE_ID="Fgh5tmkbqAD6ba6CY7p2_dXRPIJsVFHASo4HrtY0-TELJPxb2B_7B2hBv3-zq98uh-sRoBVgaonxCMpi4CAmLkvmT0fz"
$ echo $CAMIO_OAUTH_TOKEN
qdSxve9OtdpPlcsyqzhzN95cYAE7A_P
$ echo $CAMIO_BOX_DEVICE_ID
Fgh5tmkbqAD6ba6CY7p2_dXRPIJsVFHASo4HrtY0-TELJPxb2B_7B2hBv3-zq98uh-sRoBVgaonxCMpi4CAmLkvmT0fz
```

#### Get the Camio Box IP Address

You need to know the local IP address of your Camio Box. You can do this in many ways but the two easiest are 
by using either the [`arp-scan` shell program](#using-arp-scan) or the [Fing phone](#using-the-fing-application) application. 
##### Using `arp-scan`

Get the `arp-scan` tool:

```sh
# arp-scan on OSX
brew install arp-scan

# arp-scan on Linux (Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install arp-scan
```

Scan the network

You need to figure out what your network interface is, on OSX it is often `en0`, on Linux it's often `eth0` or `enp0s3`. You can check this
with the `route` tool:

**route On OSX**
```sh
$ route get example.com | grep -Eo 'interface:\s*([^\s]*)' | cut -d\  -f2
en0 # <-- this is your interface name
```

**route On Linux**
```sh
$ route | grep default | awk '{print $NF}'
enp0s3
``` 

Then run the `arp-scan` tool (replace `eth0` with your interface name)
```sh
$ sudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet 
Interface: en0, datalink type: EN10MB (Ethernet)
Starting arp-scan 1.9 with 256 hosts (http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/arp-scan/)
192.168.1.1    20:e5:2a:02:f6:fc    NETGEAR INC.,
192.168.1.10    28:10:7b:07:0c:51    D-Link International
192.168.1.20    b8:27:eb:a0:25:bc    Raspberry Pi Foundation
192.168.1.30    00:1e:06:33:d7:1a    WIBRAIN
192.168.1.51    be:fe:11:27:02:88    (Unknown)
# ....
```

Look for the entry with the MAC address of your Camio Box (for VMs this will start with `BE:FE:11`), and note down the IP address.

##### Using The Fing Application

Download the [Fing application](https://www.fing.io/) to your phone. Open the app and click the 'refresh' button on the top bar. This will kick off a scan
of the network, displaying all of the devices that it has located. Look through the list for the MAC address of your Camio Box and note down the IP address listed.

##### Get the Testing Videos

Camio supplies a [small directory of video files](https://storage.googleapis.com/camio_firmware_images/batch_import_video_files.zip) 
that you can use with the `import_video.py` program for testing purposes.  

You can either download them through your browser by click [this link](https://storage.googleapis.com/camio_firmware_images/batch_import_video_files.zip),
or you can do it with `curl` via a terminal by following the steps below.

```sh
$ cd ~
$ brew install curl

  inflating: input_videos/hikvision_office_test-camera-1495069946.mp4
```

You will now have a directory `input_videos` that contians the two files:

```
hikvision_office_test-camera-1495068758.mp4
hikvision_office_test-camera-1495069946.mp4
```

##### Constructing the File-Parsing Regex

You will be running the video-import script over a directory of video files. For this example we will assume you are using the example video files
[supplied by Camio](https://storage.googleapis.com/camio_firmware_images/batch_import_video_files.zip). Downloading and unzipping these files was described
in the [last section](#get-the-testing-videos)

As described in the previous section, you now have a directory `input_videos` that contians the two files:

```
hikvision_office_test-camera-1495068758.mp4
hikvision_office_test-camera-1495069946.mp4
```

Then you would use the following string as the regular expression passed to the video-import script.

`.*/(?P<camera>\w+?)\-.*\-(?P<epoch>\d+)\.mp4`

This captures the `hikvision_office_test` part as the camera name (used for registering the camera with Camio), and parses the `1495068758` part as the Unix-timestamp
of the video.


#### Submitting Camera-Plan and Image-Resolution Data

There are two main ways to get data into the `camio_hooks.py` module from the video-import script.

1. `--hook_data_json` argument. Supply this argument and then follow it up with a string representing a json object that contains the data needed to be passed in.
2. `--hook_data_json_file` argument. Supply this argument and then the path to a file containing a string represeting a json object with the data needed to be passed to

The values you can specify (meaningfully) as of now are:

1. `plan` - can be any of `basic`, `plus`, and `pro`. See https://www.camio.com/price for information on plans
2. `img_y_size_extraction` - the height of the frames extracted from the videos (before resizing!)
3. `img_{x,y}_size_cover` - the x,y size (in pixels) of the cover-image after resizing.
4. `img_{x,y}_size` - the x,y size (in pixels) of the non-cover images after resizing.

Note that if `img_y_size` or `img_y_size_cover` are larger than `img_y_size_extraction` we will replace the value of `img_y_size_extraction` with the larger of the two other values.
This is because it doesn't make sense to extract at a lower resolution only to scale up.


Now we only have one camera (`CAMERA_FRONT`), and we want it on the `pro` plan with all thumbnails extracted to be at 1080p resolution. We would then 
write the following to a file (call it `/tmp/hook_data.json` for this example).

```json
{
    "plan": "pro",
    "cameras": {
        "CAMERA_FRONT": {
            "plan": "pro",
            "img_y_size_extraction": 1080,
            "img_x_size_cover": 1920,
            "img_y_size_cover": 1080,
            "img_x_size": 1920,
            "img_y_size": 1080 
        },
    },
    "img_y_size_extraction": 1080,
    "img_x_size_cover": 1920,
    "img_y_size_cover": 1080
}
```

This file we will pass to the video-import script in a later step.


####  Running the video-importer Script

You are now ready to batch-import videos to Camio through your Camio Box. 

To start, go to the `video-importer` directory.

```sh
$ cd ~
$ cd examples/batch_import/video-importer
```

To see how the arguments are named/formatted/ordered as input to the scirpt you can always just give the `--help` flag to the script

```bash
$ python import_video.py --help
usage: import_video.py [-h] [-v] [-q] [-c] [-p PORT] [-r REGEX] [-s STORAGE]
                       [-d HOOK_DATA_JSON] [-f HOOK_DATA_JSON_FILE]
                       folder hook_module host

positional arguments:
  folder                full path to folder of input videos to process
  hook_module           full path to hook module for custom functions (a
                        python file)
  host                  the IP-address / hostname of the segmenter

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         set logging level to debug
  -q, --quiet           set logging level to errors only
  -c, --csv             dump csv log file
  -p PORT, --port PORT  the segmenter port number (default: 8080)
  -r REGEX, --regex REGEX
                        regex to find camera name (default:
                        .*/(?P<camera>.+?)/(?P<epoch>\d+(.\d+)?).*)
  -s STORAGE, --storage STORAGE
                        full path to the local storage db (default:
                        ./.processes.shelve)
  -d HOOK_DATA_JSON, --hook_data_json HOOK_DATA_JSON
                        a json object containing extra information to be
                        passed to the hook-module
  -f HOOK_DATA_JSON_FILE, --hook_data_json_file HOOK_DATA_JSON_FILE
                        full path to a file containing a json object of extra
                        info to be passed to the hook module
```

Run the importer with all of the values we've assembled in the previous steps.

```bash
$ python import_video.py \
  --regex ".*/(?P<camera>\w+?)\-.*\-(?P<epoch>\d+)\.mp4" \
  --host 192.168.1.57 \
  --port 8080 \
  --hook_data_json_file /tmp/hook_data.json \
  "~/input_videos" \ # folder containing input videos
  "camio_hooks" \ # hooks module with callback functions
  "192.168.1.57"  # ip-address / hosntame of the segment server

INFO:root:submitted hooks module: '/Users/user/examples/batch_import/camio_hooks.py'
INFO:root:camera_name: CAMERA_FRONT
INFO:root:epoch: 1475973350
INFO:root:/Users/user/batch_videos/CAMERA_FRONT-rand-1475973350.mp4 (scheduled for upload)

INFO:root:completed
INFO:root:finishing up...
INFO:root:Job ID: agxzfmNhbWlvLXRlc3RyEAsSA0pvYhiAgKDIhYD4CQw
```

*NOTE* - The `job_id` is returned in the last output line of the script ran above. Note down this value, you will need to give it to the [`batch_download.py`](batch_import/batch_download.py)
script in order to recover the dictionary of labels for all events discovered in the batch-import run you just finished.

If you get any errors about missing the [`device_id`](#set-the-necessary-environment-variables) of the Camio Box or an unauthenticated error, try to set the environment variables again. To check that the environment variables
are currently set, you can always `echo $CAMIO_BOX_DEVICE_ID` or `echo $CAMIO_OAUTH_TOKEN` and check that the values printed out match what you expect.


#### Seeing the Imported Video

Once the script has completed sending videos to Box for segmentation and first-order analysis, the video clips will begin to 
be available to search through on [your Camio feed](https://www.camio.com/app/#search).
You can search for the name of the camera (that was parsed from the filenames) to see the videos that have been uploaded from that camera. 

Camio is currently writing some tools to help you recover all of the labels that were generated for the batch-imported videos, but this tool is not available yet. Camio is also designing tools and an API
that will allow you to check on the status of your video processing.

#### Gathering the Labels

After batch-importing videos with the [`import_video.py`](batch_import/video-importer/import_video.py) script, you were returned a job ID. 
You can use this value along with the [`batch_download.py](batch_import/batch_download.py) script to download a bookmark of all labels for all events that
were processed through the batch-import job.


To see how to use the script, you can enter the following into a shell from the `examples/batch_import/` directory.

```bash
python batch_download.py --help
```

Which will output the following:

```sh
$ python batch_download.py --help
usage: batch_download.py [-h] [-a ACCESS_TOKEN] [-c] [-x] [-t] [-v] [-q]
                         [job_id] [output_file]
```

To gather your labels into the file `/home/user/mylabels.json`, you would run the following (assuming the `job_id` is `agxzfmNhbWlvLXRlc3RyEAsSA0pvYhiAgKDIhYD4CQw` as returned from the example above).

```sh
$ python batch_download.py agxzfmNhbWlvLXRlc3RyEAsSA0pvYhiAgKDIhYD4CQw /home/user/mylabels.json
INFO:root:Job Definition:
INFO:root:  earliest date: u'2017-05-17T13:07:36.000', latest date: u'2017-05-17T13:17:36.120000'
INFO:root:  cameras included in inquiry: [u'CAMERA_FRONT']
INFO:root:gathering over time slot: '2017-05-17T13:07:36' to '2017-05-17T13:17:36'
INFO:root:gathering over time slot: '2017-05-17T13:17:36' to '2017-05-17T13:27:36'
INFO:root:finished gathering labels
INFO:root:writing label info to file: /home/user/mylabels.json
INFO:root:labels are now available in: /home/user/mylabels.json
```

Now if you go and look at the output file (`/home/user/mylabels.json`), it will look something like this.
